Write an SQL query to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table. If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report null instead.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Person table:
+----------+----------+-----------+
| personId | lastName | firstName |
+----------+----------+-----------+
| 1        | Wang     | Allen     |
| 2        | Alice    | Bob       |
+----------+----------+-----------+
Address table:
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
| addressId | personId | city          | state      |
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
| 1         | 2        | New York City | New York   |
| 2         | 3        | Leetcode      | California |
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
Output: 
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
| firstName | lastName | city          | state    |
+-----------+-
---------+---------------+----------+
| Allen     | Wang     | Null          | Null     |
| Bob       | Alice    | New York City | New York |
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
Explanation: 
There is no address in the address table for the personId = 1 so we return null in their city and state.
addressId = 1 contains information about the address of personId = 2.'''
#answer
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT firstName,lastName,city,state from person left join address on
person.personID=address.personId;

Exanple2:
Table: Employee

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
 

Write an SQL query to report the second highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, the query should report null.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
ans)
Select Max(Salary) as SecondHighestSalary from Employee 
where salary < (Select Max(Salary) from Employee);
