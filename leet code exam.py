'''
Given an integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 38
Output: 2
Explanation: The process is
38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2 
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
Example 2:

Input: num = 0
Output: 0'''
#program:
class Solution:
    def addDigits(self, num: int) -> int:
        if num==0 or num%9!=0:
            return num%9
        else:
            return 9

'''Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 4:

Input: x = -101
Output: false'''
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        while True:
            return str(x) == str(x)[::-1]
